## Overview
- The package contains a Jupyter Python Notebook file where I perform anaylysis on the top ranking colleges in the US and try to determine the effect of rank on factors such as Costs, Admittance rate, Alumni salaries.
- The analysis can help with making college decisions for students looking to attend a school, particularly in the US
- The model uses simple Seaborn visualisations to show the relationships

## Notes
- This notebook takes you through the process of performing an analysis on college ranking data to determine factors influenced by a college ranking.
